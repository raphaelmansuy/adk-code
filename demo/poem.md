# A New Dawn

In the hush of dawn, the world exhales anew,
Leaves whisper secrets, skies brushed in gentle blue.
The river hums a lullaby, clear and bright,
Carving silver paths through stone, from dawn till night.

The wind murmurs tales of distant horizons,
Mountains rise proud, silent guardians of the sky.
Each gust a promise, a call to explore,
Reminding us that life forever soars.

Beneath the vast canopy, shadows dance in light,
Stars flicker softly, guiding the wandering night.
The moon, a silver lantern, watches from above,
Blessing earth with gentle, quiet love.

Let us tread softly, gratitude in our hearts,
Cherish each moment, each breath a fresh start.
For every sunrise, hope is reborn anew,
And each sunset, dreams are drawn through dew.
