In realms of code, where logic entwines,
A digital garden, where knowledge shines.
Each line a whisper, a thought unfurled,
Crafting wonders for a connected world.

From abstract dreams to functions grand,
The programmer's magic, a skillful hand.
Building bridges in the vast unknown,
Seeds of innovation, meticulously sown.
